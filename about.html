						<h2 class="my-1">Who is Nikola Tesla?</h2>
						<p class="mb-5">
							Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known for designing the
							alternating-current (AC) electric system, which is the predominant
							electrical system used across the world today. He also created the
							"Tesla coil," which is still used in radio technology. Born in
							modern-day Croatia, Tesla came to the United States in 1884 and
							briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He
							sold several patent rights, including those to his AC machinery,
							to George Westinghouse.
						</p>
						<h2 class="my-2">Early Life</h2>
						<p class="my-2">
							Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia, on July 10, 1856.
						</p>

						<p class="my-2">
							Tesla was one of five children, including siblings Dane, Angelina,
							Milka and Marica. Tesla's interest in electrical invention was
							spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small household
							appliances in her spare time while her son was growing up.
						</p>

						<p class="mb-5">
							Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian orthodox priest and a
							writer, and he pushed for his son to join the priesthood. But
							Nikola's interests lay squarely in the sciences.

					<h2 class="my-2">Education</h2>
					<p class="my-2">
						After studying at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the
						Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule Karlstadt) in Germany; the
						Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria; and the University of Prague
						during the 1870s, Tesla moved to Budapest, where for a time he
						worked at the Central Telephone Exchange.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						It was while in Budapest that the idea for the induction motor first
						came to Tesla, but after several years of trying to gain interest in
						his invention, at age 28 Tesla decided to leave Europe for America.
					</p>
					<h2 class="my-2">Nikola Tesla vs. Thomas Edison</h2>
					<p class="mb-5">
						In 1884 Tesla arrived in the United States with little more than the
						clothes on his back and a letter of introduction to famed inventor
						and business mogul Thomas Edison, whose DC-based electrical works
						were fast becoming the standard in the country. Edison hired Tesla,
						and the two men were soon working tirelessly alongside each other,
						making improvements to Edison's inventions. Several months later,
						the two parted ways due to a conflicting business-scientific
						relationship, attributed by historians to their incredibly different
						personalities: While Edison was a power figure who focused on
						marketing and financial success, Tesla was commercially out-of-touch
						and somewhat vulnerable.
					</p>

					<h2 class="my-2">First Solo Venture</h2>
					<p class="mb-5">
						In 1885, Tesla received funding for the Tesla Electric Light Company
						and was tasked by his investors to develop improved arc lighting.
						After successfully doing so, however, Tesla was forced out of the
						venture and for a time had to work as a manual laborer in order to
						survive. His luck would change two years later when he received
						funding for his new Tesla Electric Company.
					</p>
					<h2 class="my-2">Inventions</h2>

					<p class="mb-5">
						Throughout his career, Tesla discovered, designed and developed
						ideas for a number of important inventions — most of which were
						officially patented by other inventors — including dynamos
						(electrical generators similar to batteries) and the induction
						motor. He was also a pioneer in the discovery of radar technology,
						X-ray technology, remote control and the rotating magnetic field —
						the basis of most AC machinery. Tesla is most well-known for his
						contributions in AC electricity and for the Tesla coil.
					</p>

					<h3 class="my-2 text-sub">AC Electrical System</h3>
					<p class="mb-5">
						Tesla designed the alternating-current (AC) electrical system, which
						would quickly become the preeminent power system of the 20th century
						and has remained the worldwide standard ever since. In 1887, Tesla
						found funding for his new Tesla Electric Company, and by the end of
						the year, he had successfully filed several patents for AC-based
						inventions. Tesla's AC system soon caught the attention of American
						engineer and businessman George Westinghouse, who was seeking a
						solution to supplying the nation with long-distance power. Convinced
						that Tesla's inventions would help him achieve this, in 1888 he
						purchased his patents for $60,000 in cash and stock in the
						Westinghouse Corporation. As interest in an AC system grew, Tesla
						and Westinghouse were put in direct competition with Thomas Edison,
						who was intent on selling his direct-current (DC) system to the
						nation. A negative press campaign was soon waged by Edison, in an
						attempt to undermine interest in AC power. Unfortunately for Edison,
						the Westinghouse Corporation was chosen to supply the lighting at
						the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and Tesla
						conducted demonstrations of his AC system there.

					<h3 class="my-2 text-sub">Hydroelectric Power Plant</h3>

					<p class="mb-5">
						In 1895, Tesla designed what was among the first AC hydroelectric
						power plants in the United States, at Niagara Falls. The following
						year, it was used to power the city of Buffalo, New York — a feat
						that was highly publicized throughout the world and helped further
						AC electricity’s path to becoming the world’s power system.

							Falls, New York in 1882.

					<h3 class="my-2 text-sub">Tesla Coil</h3>

					<p class="mb-5">
						In the late 19th century, Tesla patented the Tesla coil, which laid
						the foundation for wireless technologies and is still used in radio
						technology today. The heart of an electrical circuit, the Tesla coil
						is an inductor used in many early radio transmission antennas.
